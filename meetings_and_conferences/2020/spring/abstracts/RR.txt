The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts, early-career faculty, and graduate students whose interests lie in the use of mathematical biology to investigate heterogeneous models arising in ecology and epidemiology. Our intention is that this meeting will not only be a good opportunity for researchers to find common ground, but will also provide a chance for interested early-career faculty to gain insight into this area as they begin to make their own contributions. The interaction between mathematicians, biologists, and medical professionals will provide a unique opportunity for all involved to experience truly interdisciplinary interactions and research. Our overarching goal is to foster a collaborative ffort to find common themes amongst diverse researchers, identify important open questions in this field, and to focus continued ffort in the direction of studying the importance of heterogeneity in biological models.
