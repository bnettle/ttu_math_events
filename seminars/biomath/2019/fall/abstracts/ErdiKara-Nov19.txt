In  this  work,  we  study  the  effect  of  drug  distribution  on  tumor  cell  death  whenthe drug is internally injected in the tumorous tissue.  We derive a full 3-dimensionalinhomogeneous â€“ anisotropic diffusion model.  To capture the anisotropic nature of thediffusion process in the model, we use an MRI data of a 35-year old patient diagnosedwith Glioblastoma multiform(GBM) which is the most common and most aggressiveprimary brain tumor.  After preprocessing the data with a medical image processingsoftware, we employ finite element method in parallel setting to numerically simulatethe full model and produce dose-response curves.  Finally we illustrate the apoptosis(cell death) fractions in the tumorous region over the course of the simulation.  Sincethe  model  is  built  directly  on  the  top  of  a  patient-specific  data,  we  hope  that  thisstudy will make a contribution to the individualized cancer treatment efforts from acomputational bio-mechanics viewpoint.
