The simulation of high-dimensional problems with manageable computational resource represents a long standing challenge. In a series of our recent work, a class of sparse grid DG methods has been formulated for solving various types of partial differential equations in high dimensions. By making use of the multiwavelet tensor-product bases on sparse grids in conjunction with the standard DG weak formulation, such a novel method is able to significantly reduce the computation and storage cost compared with full grid DG counterpart, while not compromising accuracy much for sufficiently smooth solutions. In this work, we consider the high-dimensional Helmholtz equation with variable coefficients and demonstrate that for such a problem the efficiency of the sparse grid DG method can be further enhanced by exploring a semi-orthogonality property associated with the multiwavelet bases, motivated by the work of C. Pflaum. The detailed convergence analysis shows that the modified sparse grid DG method attains the same order accuracy, but the resulting stiffness matrix is much sparser than that by the original method.
