\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
Under a generalized nonresonance condition, the scalar delay differential equation $x'(t)=g(x(t),x(t-\tau))=f(t)$
has a unique bounded solution for every bounded continuous forcing function $f$.  We consider properties of
$f$ that are inherited by the solution (e.g., periodicity) and what happens to the solution under certain
perturbations of $f$.
