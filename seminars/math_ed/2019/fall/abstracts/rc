To say something is "gendered" might mean that it is characteristic of or suited to one gender or another, 
or perhaps it is simply experienced differently. Biases also play important roles, which can be difficult recognize and talk about. 
To kick us off, we'll review the following post, which provides an overview of some of the math education work in this space:
Current Research on Gender Differences in Math by C. Ganley and S. Lubienski, posted May 9, 2016

In the subsequent discussion, we might consider such issues as the impacts of and mitigation approaches for teacher's math anxiety, 
or ways in which we as math instructors and advocates might be unconsciouslysupporting or excluding particular interests and values.
