This language was cast aside completely by the mid 20th century in favor of ugly limit-style arguments. Yet at the same time AndreÃÅ Weil and Alexander Grothendieck came up with a very simple and elegant way to formalize infinitesimals: nilpotent elements in rings of functions. In this expository talk I will explain an extremely elegant formulation of differential forms in this language: the de Rham complex is isomorphic (and not merely quasi-isomorphic) to the infinitesimal smooth singular cochain complex with real coefficients. The talk will be accessible to graduate students, no prior knowledge of differential forms will be assumed or required."
