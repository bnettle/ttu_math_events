 Geometric PDEs are concerned with utilizing PDE techniques to study geometric problems. A general theme in my research is the investigation of equilibrium configurations with respect to natural quantities modelling the energy or entropy of geometric objects. Those equilibria enjoy several extremal properties that are usually described by elliptic PDEs. Consequently, understanding these equations would advance our knowledge about the associated geometries. In this talk, I'll describe my contribution to fundamental conjectures in the following concrete directions. First, we'll discuss PDEs on manifolds, exploiting elliptic equations that arise in special manifolds particularly in dimension four. The second direction focuses on geometric eigenvalue problems. Here the geometry of an object is examined through studying appropriate elliptic operators and their eigenvalues. Third, we'll talk about geometric flows and applications in which PDEs arise as a mechanism to change the shape of a manifold.
