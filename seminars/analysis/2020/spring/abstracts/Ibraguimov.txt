Motivated by recent lecture of Professor Alex Solynin I want review a very powerful and influential Lemma of Growth and its application to behavior of generalized harmonic measure in unbounded domain. Evgeni Mihailovich Landis was Professor at Mechanical and Mathematical Department of Moscow Sate University. From view of many Soviet-Russian mathematician he was underestimate scientist of second part of 20 century. His method of lemma of Growth and machinery of real analysis lie behind proof of the 16 Hilbert problem for solution of elliptic equation in non-divergent. He was very gifted scientist and also contributed in the area which now called deep learning. His AVL algorithm considered by many expert in Google and other software researcher as one of the best fast searching algorithm. He has many followers now days well recognized world class scientists. I was one of his pupil and learned from him not only science but also method of thinking.
