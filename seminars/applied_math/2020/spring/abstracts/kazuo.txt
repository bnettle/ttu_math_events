It is well-known that the three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations have found much applications in our real world, e.g., aerospace, fluid mechanics, and even medical sciences. In PDE & Analysis community, it is also famous for being selected as one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems declared by the Clay Research Institute. Indeed, while the 2D Navier-Stokes equations is L2-norm critical (and hence it was solved almost a century ago by Leray), the 3D Navier-Stokes equations is L2-norm supercritical, and similarly to many other supercritical nonlinear PDEs (e.g., wave equation), the global regularity of its solution has remained extremely difficult. In 2009, Terence Tao proved the global regularity of logarithmically supercritical wave equation and this new direction has spread to many other PDEs (Boussinesq, Euler, magnetohydrodynamics, Navier-Stokes, quasi-geostrophic). I will describe the difficulty of the Navier-Stokes equations using fractional Laplacians, and then use harmonic analysis tools such as the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and Bernstein's inequality to describe this new phenomenon. The talk will have some Analysis content, but I will do my best to make it accessible to graduate students.
