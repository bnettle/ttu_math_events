\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
For many years asymptotic regulation has been an important design
objective for both lumped and distributed parameter systems and an
impressive variety of technical approaches have been used in the
design of control laws for solving a wide variety of tracking and
disturbance rejection problems. In this talk, we describe a new
approach,  which we call 'the zero dynamics inverse (ZDI) method',
which can be used for designing a feedback compensation scheme
achieving asymptotic regulation, i.e., asymptotic tracking and/or
disturbance rejection, for many systems governed by boundary
controlled linear or nonlinear distributed parameter systems.  We will
also discuss the relationship between the ZDI method and control laws
obtained  by solving the regulator equations from the well known
geometric regulator theory as developed by C.I. Byrnes and A. Isidori
for lumped nonlinear systems and recently extended to nonlinear
distributed parameter systems by D.S. Gilliam and C.I. Byrnes. Some
examples will be given for  boundary control systems governed by
(nonlinear) parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs in one and two spatial
dimensions.
