 This talk is concerned with the Uniformization problem: which intrinsic qualities of a metric space allow a good parameterization by a
Euclidean space? In the first part of the talk, we consider geometrically good (conformal, quasiconformal) parameterizations. While
including a wide range of fractal examples, spaces as such enjoy geometric and analytic properties and a great amount of first-order
calculus can be performed on them. In the second part of the talk, we discuss measure-theoretically good (Lipschitz, Holder)
parameterizations. The problem of classifying spaces admitting such parameterizations is is one of the most important problems
in geometric measure theory and it is associated to the famous Traveling Salesman Problem.
