Conformal geometry is the study of spaces where we can define the angles of crossing curves, but not their lengths. One of the most successful programs for studying conformal geometry has been the holographic program initiated by Fefferman and Graham, which proceeds by realizing the conformal space as the "boundary at infinity" of a complete Riemannian Einstein manifold of one higher dimension. I will describe this program, and then discuss my project to extend it to conformal spaces which themselves have boundaries. This entails relating the conformal space to an Einstein manifold with a "corner at infinity" of codimension two, and the presence of the corner leads to several interesting analytic complications arising from doubly singular PDEs.
