Ungulates like zebras suffer from outbreaks of anthrax, a fatal infestation
which thus causes short-term and potentially long-term disruptions to the
food supply of scavengers like jackals.  Jackals, meanwhile, can carry
rabies, but their intraspecific contact rate depends on zebra carcass
density in a complex way, as they spread rabies only when feeding.  Recent
work by Borchering et al. developed a mathematical model for this contact
rate using data from Etosha National Park in Namibia.  A dynamical systems
model for the transmission dynamics of both diseases uses reproduction
numbers to show how each disease affects the other, as well as the two host
species.
