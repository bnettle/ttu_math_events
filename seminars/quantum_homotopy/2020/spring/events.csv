1,15,2 pm,MATH 111,Daniel Grady,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,https://sites.google.com/view/danielgrady/,DoubleT.jpg,"Smooth stacks and Čech cocycles 1","This talk will provide an introduction to smooth stacks.  The talk will begin with some motivation and continue with several explicit examples of cocycle data which can be obtained via descent.  The talk will conclude with an outlook of the general theory."

The talk will begin with a discussion on model structures and Bousfield localization and continue with presentations for the infinity category of smooth stacks.  We will use Dugger’s characterization of cofibrant objects to unpackage cocycle data explicitly in several examples."
