This talk will present a discussion of the first-order traffic flow modeling paradigm, i.e. the LWR theory and its extensions, with a particular focus on the gaps between the theory and practice and how they motivate my recent works. I will first present an application of the first-order theory to solve the faulty traffic sensor diagnosis problem. Then I will present a class of ‘ill-posed’ continuous-time dynamic point-queue models and provide a constructive procedure to derive their closed-form solutions. Last, I will discuss the challenges to model heterogeneous traffic flow and a pragmatic data-informed modeling framework to fill the gap.
