Problems involving fluids are ubiquitous in science and engineering.
 Their understanding is of great importance for the prediction 
 of the behaviour of many real-life phenomena.
 Their mathematical description is among the most challenging efforts of the scientific community.
  In this talk I will discuss some problems involving fluid dynamics
 that have been the subject of my research in the last years:
 Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection, 
 Fluid-Structure Interaction,
 hydraulic fracturing 
 and optimal control of fluid dynamics equations.
 Attention will be paid to both computational and theoretical aspects,
 such as preconditioning of linearized algebraic systems and convergence conditions.
 This work is the result of several collaborations 
 with colleagues at TTU and other institutions, 
 along with financial support from the National Science Foundation.
