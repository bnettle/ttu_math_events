\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
There are some special subclasses of 2-surfaces which arise in various parts of mathematics such as Willmore surfaces, Willmore-like surfaces, surfaces solving the shape equation of lipid membrane, and surfaces solving the generalized shape equation. However, in order to obtain these surfaces a highly nonlinear differential equation needs to be solved which is quite difficult in general. We use an alternative approach. We develop surfaces using integrable equations such as Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV), Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger (NLS), Sine Gordon (SG) equations. The relation between surfaces and integrable equation is established by the use of Lie groups and Lie algebras.  In this talk, we present construction 2-surfaces from NLS equation using spectral parameter deformation. These surfaces contain a family Weingarten and Willmore-like surfaces. We show that some NLS surfaces solve the generalized shape equation which is derived from a variational principle. We also give a method for constructing the position vectors of NLS surfaces by using soliton solution of NLS equation. We also present the graph of interesting NLS surfaces.
