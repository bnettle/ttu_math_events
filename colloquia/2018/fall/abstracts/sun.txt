Statistical inference on the covariance matrix has a variety of applications in many different
areas, such as gene expression analysis, remote sensing and financial portfolio analysis. As an
estimate of the population covariance matrix, the sample covariance matrix performs quite well
in the classical setting. However, it becomes ill-conditioned or even singular and thus behaves
poorly in high-dimensional setting. Stein-type shrinkage approach is commonly used to tackle
this difficult problem when the dimensionality is large. A convex combination of the sample
covariance matrix and a well-conditioned target matrix is considered to estimate the
covariance matrix. Recent work in the literature has shown that an optimal combinationexists
undermean-squaredloss,however itmustbe estimatedfromthe data. In this talk, we introduce
a new set of estimators for the optimal convex combination for three commonly used target
matrices. A simulation study shows an improvement over those in the literature in cases of
extreme high-dimensionality of the data. Interestingly, the results can also be applied to some
testing problems on the high-dimensional covariance matrix.
