Multiple recurrent outbreak cycles have been commonly observed in
infectious diseases such as measles and chicken pox. These complex disease outbreak behaviors are rarely captured by deterministic models. In
this talk, we investigate a simple 2-dimensional SI model and propose that
the coexistence of multiple attractors attributes to complex outbreak patterns. We first determine parameter conditions for the existence of an
isolated center, then properly perturb the model to generate Hopf bifurcation and obtain limit cycles around the center. We further analytically
prove that the maximum number of the coexisting limit cycles is three,
and provide a corresponding parameter set for the existence of three limit
cycles. Simulation results demonstrate three coexisting attractors, which
contain one unstable endemic equilibrium and two stable limit cycles separated by one unstable limit cycle. Various disease dynamics can be predicted by a single nonlinear deterministic model based on different initial data.
