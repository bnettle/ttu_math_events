In recent years, fractional differential equations have become quite prevalent in applied mathematics. When used correctly, these non-local operators can model non-standard transport, such as anomalous diffusion, in many applications of interest (such as porous media). Approximations of fractional operators is still a highly nontrivial process as one must preserve the non-locality of the underlying operators in order of for the method to be valid. In this talk, we will introduce the notion of fractional powers of a class of abstract operators and construct appropriate approximations of these operators via a generalization of a method employed by Caffarelli and Silvestre. These techniques make no assumption of boundedness on the operators, and thus, may be employed in numerous numerical and analytical settings. The stability and convergence of this method can easily be related back to the spectral nature of the operator of interest. Numerical experiments will be presented to further verify the presented results.
