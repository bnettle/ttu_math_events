Curvature flows are used both theoretically and computationally to change the geometry of a surface in a prescribed way.  Here we examine the p-Willmore flow, which arises from movement by the L^2 gradient of the p-Willmore functional, and develop a unified finite-element model for its behavior on closed surfaces immersed in R^3.  This model is amenable to constraints on surface area and enclosed volume, and includes a regularization procedure which encourages conformality along the flow.  Following this, discretization of the relevant nonlinear systems is discussed, and an algorithm for running the flow is presented with accompanying video.
