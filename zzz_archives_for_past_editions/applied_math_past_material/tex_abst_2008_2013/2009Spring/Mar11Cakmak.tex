ABSTRACT.
In this presentation, I will introduce my current research problem: A fully coupled system of equations describing the interaction between a fluid and a structure in a one-dimensional setting. In analyzing such a system, we aim to develop an understanding of the optimal control strategies which can be extended to problems of higher dimension, and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, a two-dimensional model of fluid-structure interaction may behave locally  in such a way that a one-dimensional simplification is appropriate. This work is still under progress and the comments and suggestions from the audience will be highly appreciated.
