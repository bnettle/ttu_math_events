In 1927 Polya proved that the Riemann
Hypothesis is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of Jensen
polynomials for Riemannâ€™s Xi-function. This hyperbolicity
had only been proved for degrees d=1,2,3. We prove
the hyperbolicity of all (but possibly finitely many) the
Jensen polynomials of every degree d. Moreover, we
establish the outright hyperbolicity for all degrees
d<10^26. These results follow from an unconditional
proof of the "derivative aspect" GUE distribution for
zeros. This is joint work with Michael Griffin, Larry
Rolen, and Don Zagier.
