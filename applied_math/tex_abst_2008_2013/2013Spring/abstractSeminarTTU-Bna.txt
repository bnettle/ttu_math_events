Title:
Splitting Methods In Multigrid Finite 
Element Incompressible Fluid-Structure Interaction Problems

Abstract:
In the last decades a great attention has been paid to the study 
of Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems 
because of a large number of applications ranging from 
biology to civil engineering and aeroelasticity. 
In particular, the numerical solution of the equations of Fluid-Structure Interaction 
is of great interest  because of the increasing demand from
the medical community for scientifically rigorous and quantitative investigations
of cardiovascular diseases.  

In this talk we will present the results of Fluid-Structure Interaction computations 
of an incompressible elastic solid object and a laminar incompressible viscous flow
using the Finite Element Method (FEM). 
The mathematical problem consists of the Navier-Stokes equations
in the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) form coupled with a non-linear
incompressible structure model (Neo-Hookean).
Since we are interested in solving FSI problem where the added mass effect is significative,
the coupling between the structure and the fluid is enforced inside a monolithic framework  
which computes simultaneously for the fluid and the structure 
unknowns within a unique solver.

This kind of problem can be tackled efficiently by
domain decomposition techniques. Our strategy is to solve several small local subproblems 
over subdomain patches using Vanka-smoothing or Pressure-Schur-Complement-smoothing
procedures within a multigrid algorithm.
