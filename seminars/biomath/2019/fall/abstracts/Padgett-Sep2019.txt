Self- and cross-diffusion are important, and often neglected, nonlinear spatial derivative terms that are included into population models in ecology. These terms are especially important in modeling predator-prey interactions. Self-diffusion models overcrowding effects, while cross-diffusion incorporates the response of one species in light of the concentration of another. These important terms can complicate simulating the underlying system, rendering classical computational techniques useless (or, at least highly inefficient). In this talk, we will introduce a novel computational algorithm based on operator splitting. This method will be shown to be accurate and stable through rigorous analysis. If time permits, we will also discuss adaptive time-stepping methods which exactly preserve the blow-up rate of the original model (when blow-up occurs), which are based on the self-similarity of the underlying physical system. Numerical experiments will be presented in order to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach when considering a generalized Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) model.
