In this series of two talks, we introduce the mathematics that lie behind soap films and soap bubbles by means of experiments with wires and soapy water.  From the mathematical viewpoint, we study surfaces with constant mean curvature in Euclidean space, which are models in physics of interfaces and capillary phenomena.  We will prepare a variety of experiments with soap films and soap bubbles and we will review some results of the theory and their proofs, including some open problems.
