The purpose of this talk is to give one example of a regularizing property of noise in a partial differential equation. The Hall-magnetohydrodynamic system forced by Levy noise is just one example. 

Global well-posedness of a partial differential equation in a certain Banach space informally implies particularly that given any initial data in that Banach space, there exists a unique solution in that Banach space for all time. When a partial differential equation is not known to be globally well-posed, the second best result may be the ``small initial data result;'' i.e. there exists a positive constant such that for any initial data in that Banach space with its norm less than this constant, the unique solution exists for all time. It is well known that for non-diffusive equations in fluid mechanics, such a ``small initial data'' is very difficult to obtain. In particular, obtaining such a ``small initial data'' result for deterministic Euler equations is a completely open problem, to the best of the speaker's knowledge. Nevertheless, if you force with a certain noise, then for such non-diffusive equations, including the Euler equations, the ``small initial data results'' are attainable. Therefore, a noise (random forcing term) can possibly display a regularizing property for its solution. In this talk I will  explain the idea behind this phenomenon.
