The Willmore flow of surfaces is a geometric tool known for its aesthetic beauty, and has been studied by researchers including mathematicians, physicists, and computer graphics artists.  This talk discusses a finite-element formulation of this flow for closed (possibly self-intersecting) surfaces immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which is amenable to geometric constraints on both surface area and enclosed volume.  Inspired by conformal geometry, a post-processing procedure is also presented which ensures that a given surface mesh remains nearly conformal along the Willmore flow despite its initial regularity.  This abolishes the mesh degeneration that usually accompanies position-based surface flows, and leads to a robust model that can accommodate variable time steps as well as surface genera.
