In this talk, we shall introduce the multiple zeta values (Euler-Zagier sums) from an analytic perspective. Mostly, we are interested
                 in exploring the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations among these values (MZV's). Also, we present the proof of some of the evaluations
                 which go back to Hoffman and Zagier such as $\zeta(2, 2, \ldots, 2)$ or $\zeta(1, 3, \ldots, 1,3)$. This talk should be accessible to
                 graduate students and non-specialists.
