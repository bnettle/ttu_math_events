Amin Rahman - Title: Mathematically tractable models in cancer biophysics and walking droplets
Abstract:Attacking problems through models of varying complexity often
provides a broad picture of the phenomenon of interest. If a model is burdened
by the baggage of assumptions, it will not capture the pertinent dynamics. On
the other hand, a model that does not obviate negligible contributions falls prey
to computational constraints. Sometimes, if we are fortunate, we may discover
reduction techniques that eliminate undesirable computational cost. If these
simpler models replicate the qualitative behavior of the phenomena, it may allow
for fast numerical experiments, which can often reveal insight missed by more
complex models. In this talk, I present models arising from cancer biophysics
and walking droplets, and discuss insights from fast numerical experiments.

Cezar Lupu - Title: Riemann zeta and multiple zeta values
Abstract: In this talk, we bring into perspective the infamous Riemann zeta
function and its natural generalization, the multiple zeta function. We focus more
on the evaluations of such objects at positive integers. The techniques used in
these evaluations rely on the properties of some special functions.Although they
look rather simple, it turns out that the Riemann zeta and multiple zeta values
play a very important role at the interface of analysis, number theory, geometry
and physics with applications ranging from periods of mixed Tate motives to
evaluating Feynman integrals in quantum field theory.The talk should be
accessible to non specialists and graduate students.
