\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
This represents a preliminary report regarding computational methods to construct constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces immersed in the Euclidean 3-space. The novel results to be communicated include: a). obtaining isothermic (i.e., isothermal and curvature line) coordinates, starting from an arbitrary parameterization; b). constructing dual surfaces to a given CMC surface; c). numerically solving the famous Bonnet problem, for any immersed surfaces in general, and for CMC surfaces in particular.
