ABSTRACT.
I will discuss some of my recent work on developing simulation methods for 
nanoscale devices, in particular, methods for solving the self-consistent 
Schrodinger-Poisson equation in complex geometry. This work is in 
collaboration with Rick Muller and Bart van Bloemen Waanders of Sandia 
National Laboratories.
