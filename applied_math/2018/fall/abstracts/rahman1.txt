Recent experiments on walking droplets show the existence of complex dynamics including new global bifurcations and chaotic motion.  I present models from walkers in a confined rectilinear geometry and on an annulus.  The models are shown to achieve both qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experiments of a single walker, and makes predictions about heretofore unobserved behavior of multiple droplets.  Using dynamical systems techniques and bifurcation theory, the single droplet models are analyzed to prove dynamics suggested by the numerical simulations.
