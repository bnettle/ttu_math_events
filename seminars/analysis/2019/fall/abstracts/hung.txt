Stationary surfaces with boundaries frequently arise as the critical points of energy functionals which depend on the curvature. For example, the area functional gives rise to minimal surfaces while the Willmore functional corresponds to Willmore surfaces. In this talk, we study various boundary-value problems and characterize free-boundary stationary surfaces with rotational symmetry in case the functional is scaling invariant. We also discuss interesting boundary-to-interior effects in case the functional is not scaling invariant. This is a joint work with Anthony Gruber and Magdalena Toda.
