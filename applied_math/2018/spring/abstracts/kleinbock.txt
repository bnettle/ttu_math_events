Dynamics on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups has been a useful tool in solving many previously intractable Diophantine problems. In this talk I will illustrate some well-known connections between homogeneous dynamics and number theory, and then talk about some more recent developments -- studying distribution of rational points on spheres and other quadric hypersurfaces. The new work is joint with Lior Fishman, Keith Merrill and Davis Simmons.
