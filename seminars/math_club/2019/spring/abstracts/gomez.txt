 Communities, groups of nodes in a graph that are closely related among each other but loosely related to the other nodes in the network, exists within the species, gene, and protein networks of a microbiome. Many different algorithms have been developed to detect these communities, two of which include the Girvan-Newman algorithm and the Louvain algorithm. Trials run on assortative planted partiton models assess the accuracy of these algorithms with respect to their computational time. When applying community detection algorithms to dynamic graphs with community structure imposed by the Chinese restaurant stochastic process, initial results show promising use of the Jaccard index as well as the Pointwise Mutual Information index as tracking methods.
