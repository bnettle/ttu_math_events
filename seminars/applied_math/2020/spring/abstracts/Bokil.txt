We consider a variety of different constitutive models for 
modeling the Kerr effect in nonlinear optics. These include the 
instantaneous cubic Kerr model and the cubic dispersive Duffing model for 
the time evolution of the electric polarization. Appending these 
constitutive laws to Maxwell's equations we construct fully discrete 
energy stable finite difference discretizations of the resulting nonlinear 
Maxwell models. Numerical simulations illustrate discrete energy stability 
and provide a comparison between the performance of the different models.
