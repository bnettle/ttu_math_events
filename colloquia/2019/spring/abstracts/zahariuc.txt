Severi varieties are roughly parameter
spaces for algebraic plane curves of fixed degree and
geometric genus. More generally, we can use the same
term to describe parameter spaces for curves of a given
homology class and geometric genus on any projective
surface. I will focus on the (open, with some notable
exceptions) problem of determining their irreducible
components. The talk will presume little to no
background in algebraic geometry.
