\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
A millimeter-size nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most
important model organisms used for investigations ranging from
cellular development to genetics to neurobiology.  Since the topology
of neural connections of this nematode has been fully mapped out, it
should be possible to reverse engineer how its nervous system
functions.  This great challenge requires systematic studies of
biophysics of nematode locomotion in complex environments to quantify
the interplay of sensing processes, control mechanisms, and mechanical
interactions that include frictional, capillary, and hydrodynamic
forces.  In this talk we will analyze the kinematics of nematode
motion, present simple models of neuromuscular control of the nematode
body, and show how they can be used to elucidate chemotaxis
mechanisms.  Such studies, in addition to their fundamental value, are
necessary for practical applications, for example to screen genes
associated with neuromuscular diseases. This vast knowledge base may
also be harnessed to design smart artificial crawlers.
