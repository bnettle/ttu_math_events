 In this talk, we present our recent development of high order numerical methods on sparse grids. We first review
the sparse grid discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for transport
equations and apply it to kinetic simulations. The method uses the weak formulations
of traditional Runge-Kutta DG schemes for hyperbolic problems and is proven to be $L^2$
stable and convergent. A major advantage of the scheme lies in its low computational
and storage cost due to the employed sparse finite element approximation space. This
attractive feature is explored in simulating linear and nonlinear transport problems including the celebrated Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell System. We then discuss our very recent development on another novel high order sparse grid method, which is as effective and
efficient as the DG counterpart for box-shaped domains, but more flexible and easier to implement on
unstructured meshes. Some preliminary results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our new method.
