The Effects of Soft Errors on Krylov Methods Including a Fault
Tolerant Conjugate Gradient Algorithm

As architectures are developed with smaller components
operating a lower voltages, soft errors (i.e., bit flips) become 
potentially worrying, and in fact may not even be detected. 
We investigate the sensitivity of several Krylov methods to soft errors. 
We apply sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the relative
importance of algorithmic locations where the bit flips occur.
We compare their effects on several Krylov methods including a new fault
tolerant variant of the flexible CG algorithm.
