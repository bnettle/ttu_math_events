We develop and analyze a 2x2 dynamical system describing flow through a single pore to study the dynamics of the appearance and dissolution of gas bubbles during two-component (CO2, H2O), two-phase (gas, liquid) flow. Our analysis indicates that three regimes occur at conditions pertinent to petroleum reservoirs. These regimes correspond to a critical point changing type from an unstable node to an unstable spiral and then to a stable spiral as flow rates increase. Only in the stable spiral case do gas bubbles achieve a steady-state finite size. Otherwise, all gas bubbles that form undergo, possibly oscillatory, growth and then dissolve completely. Under steady flow conditions, this formation and dissolution repeats cyclically. In this talk I will: - present the mathematical model and derive the dynamical system,
- summarize the direction fields, critical points and solution trajectories, 
- report the results of numerical solutions to the dynamical system 
- provide summary critique of the work.
