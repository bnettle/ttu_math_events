Premature delivery or Preterm birth is a major concern across the developing and developed world. 
It remains as the leading cause of perinatal mortality with a significant strain on healthcare costs. 
Risk factors and biomarkers used so far have been ineffective in identifying the majority of preterm deliveries. 
This study focuses on developing and validating a mass spectrometry based protein biomarker test to predict spontaneous preterm delivery in asymptomatic pregnant women. 
Maternal serum was processed by a proteomic workflow, and proteins were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. 
We evaluated a predictor composed of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IBP4) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in a clinical validation study to classify 
spontaneous preterm delivery cases (<370/7 weeks gestational age). The predictor had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.75. 
This early detection would guide enhanced levels of care and accelerate development of clinical strategies to prevent preterm delivery.
