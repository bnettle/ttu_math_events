We investigate problem of convergence of Fourier expansions
(trigonometric Fourier series, Walsh-Fourier series, Fourier integrals) in multidimensional
case, namely, we are interested in the following problem. How
are the sets of convergence and divergence almost everywhere of multiple
Fourier expansion changed when a function $f$, which generates this expansion,
is changed on the function $f\circ \psi$, when $\psi$ belongs to some class $\Psi$ of
linear transformations of $\mathbb R^N$, $N\ge 2$, in particular, to the group of rotations
of $\mathbb R^N$ about the origin.
