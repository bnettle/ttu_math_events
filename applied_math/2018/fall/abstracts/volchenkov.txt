Stochastic counterparts of nonlinear dynamics problems might be studied by 
non-perturbative functional methods developed in the framework of quantum
field theory. Keywords: Kolmogorovâ€™ 1941 (Navier-Stokes turbulence), transport through
porous media, waterspouts, tsunami waves, stochastic magnetohydrodynamics, self-organized criticality, etc.
