Ecological stoichiometry is an approach that focuses on the balance of energy and elements in environmentalinteractions, and it leads to new insights and a better understanding of ecological processes and outcomes.Modeling under this framework enables us to investigate the effects of nutrient content (i.e., food quality)on organisms whether the imbalance involves insufficient or excess nutrient content.  This phenomenon iscalled the “stoichiometric knife-edge.” In this study, we develop and analyze a three-trophic-level food chainmodel that captures this phenomenon.  The model tracks two essential elements, carbon, and phosphorus, ineach species.  We analyze the dynamics of the system, such as boundedness and positivity of the solutions,existence, and stability conditions of boundary and internal equilibria.  Through numerical simulations andbifurcation analyses, we observe the switching of the dynamics of the system between periodic oscillationsand chaos.  Our findings also show that nutrient-rich food consumption causes (direct or indirect) adverseeffects on species.
