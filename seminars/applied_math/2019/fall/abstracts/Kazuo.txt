When modeling the real world, there are three immediate reasons to add a noise so that a deterministic equation becomes stochastic. Firstly, an external force (e.g. wind if modeling waves) is naturally random. Secondly, adding a noise turns the statement on the solution to be probabilistic, and thereby informally excuses the model for not being precise or complete. Thirdly, classical deterministic PDEs apply only to macroscopic scales, and stochastic PDEs model the microscopic scales much better. Behind such motivations, quite a lot of literature has been devoted to PDEs with noise which is white in time. However, for many decades physicists and engineers have actually favored forcing by a noise that is white in both space and time. Their applications were somewhat groundless because with the classical mathematical theory, solutions to such stochastic PDEs forced by space-time white noise, singular PDEs, were ill-defined. It is only due to the breakthrough results in the last five years that we now have theorems on the solutions to such singular PDEs, which we can rigorously prove.
