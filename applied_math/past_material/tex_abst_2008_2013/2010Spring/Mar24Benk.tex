This talk is mainly about the Peano space filling curve and its
application as a mesh for PDE framework. 

  The space filling curves have in general different mathematical
properties, but we are interested in properties which make the
underlying mesh cache efficient and high-performance. Beside Hilbert and
Sierpinski curve the Peano curve provides an efficient N dimensional
mesh support.

  In our research group we developed a general "Peano" framework, which
allows the development of solvers for different applications. Among them
are Navier-Stokes, Lattice-Boltzmann, and Fluid Structure Interaction.

  Finally we will discuss the results and further challenges of the
Peano mesh integration into the Sundance PDE toolbox.
