\newcommand{\talkabstract}{In this talk some qualitative results regarding generalized Forchheimer equations in porous media will be presented. In particular I will discuss asymptotic behavior of the solution of the IBVP for non-linear parabolic equation modeling under some assumption Forcheimer type flows in porous media.
