Amin Rahman, "Simple Models in a Complex World": When thinking of simple models, one may recall the logistic map by Robert May (Nature 1976); a difference equation with a quadratic right hand side. It is so simple that a middle school student can iterate the map to observe the dynamics, and yet it may be used for something as complex as modeling populations. In this talk we discuss models arising from wave dynamics, electronic circuits, fluid wave-particle interactions, and drug diffusion in tumors. In addition, some of the mathematical techniques used to analyze the models are also presented.
 --- Josh Padgett, "Operator Splitting Methods for Approximating Differential Equations": Splitting methods have been used to approximate solutions to problems arising in analysis, differential geometry, algebra, and differential equations. Classically, these methods have primarily been employed in linear problems, however. This talk will introduce the concept of operator splitting and then demonstrate its effective use in solving certain nonlinear differential equations. In particular, we will consider a singular solid-fuel ignition model and a generalized SKT predator-prey model. The latter portion of the talk will briefly discuss the potential to apply these splitting ideas to various nonlocal and stochastic problems.
