\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
In August 1945, evidence of the most spectacular
contribution of Physics to the war effort came in the form of a
mushroom cloud. The grand contribution of Mathematics, however,
remained secret well into the 1970s. It was the effort to crack the
German Enigma cipher machine.

In the talk will give a brief survey of this momentous effort. It is
an entertaining story of elementary mathematics with nontrivial
implications for world history.
