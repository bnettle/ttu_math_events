In June 23, 2006's issue of Science magazine,
Pendry et al and Leonhardt independently published their
papers on electromagnetic cloaking with metamaterials. Since
then, there is a growing interest in using metamaterials to
design invisibility cloaks and other interesting devices. In
this talk, I will present some time-domain cloaking models
we studied in recent years. Well-posedness study and
various time-domain finite element methods will be
discussed. I will show numerical simulations of invisibility
cloaks and other interesting simulations such as optical
black holes. I will conclude the talk with some open
issues.
