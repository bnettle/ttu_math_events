 
In Part I of the talk, we first review the asymptotic expansions
of Foias-Saut-type for all Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the three-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations of viscous, incompressible fluids with periodic boundary
conditions, when the body forces decay in time either exponentially or algebraically.
We then introduce appropriate systems of decaying functions and corresponding
asymptotic expansions in those systems. We prove that if the force has a large-time
asymptotic expansion in Gevrey-Sobolev spaces in such a general system, then any
Leray-Hopf weak solution admits an asymptotic expansion of the same type. In Part
II, we present recent studies of the generalized Forchheimer isentropic gas flows in
porous media, and complex flows of mixed regimes, namely, pre-Darcy, Darcy and
post-Darcy in the same domain. Rigorous estimates, continuous dependence and
structural stability results are established.
