In this talk I will present some preliminary result obtained from the modified chemotaxis model proposed by Angie Piece. I will present the primitive model of two-species interaction depending on light availability.  The Proof of existence and uniqueness  for the primitive solution will be presented.  From the obtained estimates one can conclude time stability (but not  asymptotic) of the constructed solution.
I naively hope that our approach can also highlights aspects of the evolution of the primitive live in reservoir, using PDE techniques.  Most likely I'm very wrong! Most of the observation which will be presented are obtained by collaboration and joint discussion with Angie Piece and Eugenio Aulisa.
