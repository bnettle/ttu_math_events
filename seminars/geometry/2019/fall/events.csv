I will start with the traditional definition by Eilenberg and Steenrod, in which a cohomology theory is a sequence of functors $h^n\colon{\rm Top}^{\rm op}\to{\rm Ab}$ together with coboundary maps $\partial^n\colon h^n(A)\to h^{n+1}(X/A)$ and explain how it can be generalized to better capture the geometric aspects of such theories."

Globally, the satisfaction of these structural equations have obstructions detected precisely by (higher) prolongations of the corresponding G-structures, governed by differential-graded Lie algebras. These obstructions can be compared to the well-understood almost-complex and almost-quaternionic cases (classical Kodaira-Spencer vs. twistor theory). We present also the obstruction for the second complex Clifford algebra, known as the bicomplex numbers, describing an existence result for integrable almost-bicomplex structures, and two compatible double-complexes of differential forms (one elliptic, one non-elliptic) which has its own cohomology and notion of spectral sequence. We draw attention to the previously unobserved similarities between this formalism and work on the “generalized geometry” of Hitchin, Gualtieri, Cavalcanti, and others, suggesting applications of the bicomplex differential geometry to problems in T-duality. If time allows we may suggest a related spectral sequence for almost-quaternionic geometry based on the work of Widdows."
