3,6,4:00 PM,MATH 112,Vlad Matei,Department of Mathematics,"University of California, Irvine",https://www.math.uci.edu/people/vlad-matei,DoubleT.jpg,Point counting and cohomology,"I will explain how most of the arithmetic statistics questions over functions can be approached from a geometrical viewpoint. The main tool involved is the Grothendieck Lefschetz trace formula and twisted versions of it, which allows to translate between point counts and studying the geometry of the underlying variety that parametrizes the objects we want to count."
3,11,3:00 PM,MATH 112,Peter Ulrickson,Department of Mathematics,Catholic University of America,http://math.cua.edu/faculty/profiles/ulrickson.cfm,DoubleT.jpg,Supersymmetric Euclidean Field Theories and K-theory,"A functorial quantum field theory is a symmetric monoidal functor from a category of bordisms to a category of vector spaces. I will present some aspects of Stolz and Teichner's approach to relating functorial quantum field theories and cohomology theories. Specifically, I will sketch the case of 1-dimensional supersymmetric Euclidean field theories and topological K-theory."
3,27,4:00 PM,MATH 112,Alastair Hamilton,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,,DoubleT.jpg,Ribbon graph decomposition of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces,"In this talk I will describe a decomposition of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces into orbi-cells. We will need this background for subsequent talks."
4,3,4:00 PM,MATH 112,Alastair Hamilton,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,,DoubleT.jpg,Ribbon graph decomposition of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.  Part II,"This time around, I will discuss orbi-cell decompositions of compactifications of the moduli space. We will need this background for subsequent talks."
4,10,4:00 PM,MATH 112,Alastair Hamilton,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,,DoubleT.jpg,Algebraic model for homology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces,"In this talk, I will describe a theorem due to Kontsevich that recovers the homology of the one-point compactification of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces in terms of the homology of a certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. Time permitting, I will discuss more refined compactifications of the moduli space."
4,17,4:00 PM,MATH 112,Charles Frohman,Department of Mathematics,University of Iowa,https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~frohman/,DoubleT.jpg,Invariants of geometric structures of three-manifolds derived from the Kauffman bracket,"I will recap the representation theory of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface and show how it can be used to derive invariants depending on the hyperbolic of a three-manifold."

5,1,4:00 PM,MATH 112,Adrian Zahariuc,Department of Mathematics,"University of California, Davis",https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/people/general-profile?fac_id=azahariuc,DoubleT.jpg,A Riemann-Hurwitz-Plucker formula,"The classical Riemann-Hurwitz and Plucker formulas give the number of ramification points of maps between (algebraic) curves, and of maps from a curve to a projective space respectively. They overlap in the case of a map from a curve to the projective line, where they give the same formula. I will state a common generalization of these two formulas, obtained in joint work with Brian Osserman."
