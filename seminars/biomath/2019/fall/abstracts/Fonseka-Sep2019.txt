Plant-pollinator interactions play an important role in the maintenance of the balance of nature. All organisms living in the environment are composed of different ratios of chemical elements. By considering the balance of essential chemical elements in nature, we can formu- late mathematical models to study their role in the dynamics of the system as well as nature. We formulate and analyze stoichiometric plant-pollinator and stoichiometric herbivore-plant- pollinator models. Our models include three dimensional and four-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations to represent the plant, pollinator, herbivore populations, as well as the varying nutrient levels of the plant. We analyze the dynamics of the systems such as non- negativeness and boundedness of solutions, as well as the existence and stability of boundary equilbria. We perform a bifurcation analysis of the models and also a parameter sensitivity analysis of stoichiometric plant-pollinator model using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient technique. LHS show that the search rate and the carrying capacity of pollinators are most important parameters to the stoichiometric plant-pollinator model. Bi- furcation analysis shows the existence of critical thresholds of number of pollinators for plants to survive and for herbivores to die.
