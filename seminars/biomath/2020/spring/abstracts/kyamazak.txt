The purpose of this talk is to share my brief experience on the PDE models of infectious diseases such as cholera, avian influenza, Ebola and Zika viruses. Classical models tend to be ODE types of SIR models (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered); the PDE types seem to be relatively new (it has caught more attention in the last decade due to remarkable developments). The typical mathematical results of the main concern are the global attractivity of the disease-free-equilibrium and uniform persistence of the disease when the basic reproduction number is beneath and above one, respectively. However, there seems to be a fundamental mathematical result that seems to be quite often glossed over, specifically global well-posedness in a reasonable spatial dimension (such as three) when the system has distinct diffusivity coefficients (it is unrealistic that the diffusivity of the susceptible and infected are same). I will try to make this talk as accessible as possible to non-experts (which should be possible because I am a non-expert).
