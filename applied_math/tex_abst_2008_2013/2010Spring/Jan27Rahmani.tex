\newcommand{\talkabstract}{Many complex systems like stock markets, heart beat dynamics, human gait, DNA walk and protein sequences can be explained by multi-fractal analysis. For describing the dynamics of multi-fractal systems a single exponent like the fractal dimension is not enough and a continues spectrum of exponent are needed. Power laws have important role in multi-fractal systems and they are used locally to describe the behavior around any point.  The key concept in this content is that many objects with random structure possess a scale symmetry and show a multi-scale behavior.

In this talk the fundamentals of multi-fractality are introduced and  it is shown that how we can apply multi-fractal analysis to extract some features of financial time series.
