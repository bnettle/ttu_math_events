In this talk we will study mappings $ f $ preserving harmonic measures of boundary sets. &nbsp;We will show that every homeomorphism $ f $ : $ \overline{D} $ → $ \overline{Ω} $ between Greenian domains $ D $ and $ Ω $ in $ R^n $, $ n $ ≥ 2, preserving harmonic measures, is a harmonic morphism. &nbsp;We will also study problems on conformality of mappings preserving harmonic measures of some specific sets on the boundaries of planar domains. &nbsp;Joint work with S. Pouliasis.
