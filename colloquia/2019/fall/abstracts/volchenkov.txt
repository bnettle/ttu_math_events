Modeling across scales is a fundamental problem in Applied Mathematics: many systems manifest radically different behavior at different spatial/temporal scales. We discuss a dynamical version of Renormalization Group methodology for bottom-up scaling in the problems of Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamics. Examples include fully developed turbulence, MHD turbulence, and sand pile models in Self-organized Criticality. The inverse, top-down scaling problem (of restoring metrics attributed to different scales that might represent the macroscopic behavior well) is known as Machine Learning. We discuss data/structure scaffolding with stochastic (diffusion) processes, including scale-sensitive (anisotropic & time-fractional) diffusions, and give a brief morphological analysis of the city of Lubbock. Finally, we plan to mention the threshold stochastic models important for modeling survival, evolution, and communication, as well as to surf over the joint project with the AVX Company on “Multi-Source Data Fusion for Aviation Sustainment”.
