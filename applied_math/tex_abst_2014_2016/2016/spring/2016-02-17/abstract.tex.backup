\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
Genome‐wide association studies can only explain a small proportion of phenotypic variation.
Epigenetic effects have been pointed out to be one plausible source of the missing heritability.
Numerous statistical methods have been developed to explore two important epigenetic factors:
genomic imprinting and maternal effects. Most of the methods, however, can only model one of
these two confounded epigenetic effects or make strong yet unrealistic assumptions about the
population to avoid over‐parameterization. In this talk, I will present a partial Likelihood method for
detecting Imprinting and Maternal Effects jointly without making assumptions about the nuisance
parameters. This method can be applied to both case-control family data and discordant sib-pair
design. By matching affected and unaffected probands and stratifying according to their familial
genotypes, a partial likelihood component free of nuisance parameters can be extracted from the full
likelihood and alleviates the need to make assumptions about the nuisance parameters. Theoretical
analysis shows that the maximum partial likelihood estimators based on the partial likelihood method
are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed with close‐form formula for computing
information. Based on the information contents per individual of different study designs, our work
offers a practical strategy and real‐time information calculation for investigators to select the
optimum study before data collection.
