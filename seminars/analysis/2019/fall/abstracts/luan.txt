We formulate the the generalized Forchheimer equations for the three-dimensional fluid flows in rotating porous media. By implicitly solving the momentum in terms of the pressure's gradient, we derive a degenerate parabolic equation for the density in the case of slightly compressible fluids and study its corresponding initial, boundary value problem. We investigate the nonlinear structure of the parabolic equation. The maximum principle is proved and used to obtain the maximum estimates for the solution. Various estimates are established for the solution's gradient, in the Lebesgue norms of any order, in terms of the initial and boundary data. All estimates contain explicit dependence on key physical parameters including the angular speed. This is joint work with Emine Celik (Sakarya University) and Thinh Kieu (University of North Georgia, Gainesville Campus).
