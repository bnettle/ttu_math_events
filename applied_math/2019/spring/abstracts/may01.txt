I will discuss our recent work on developing a one-dimensional model for the transient (unsteady) fluid--structure interaction (FSI) between a soft-walled microchannel and viscous fluid flow within it. An Euler--Bernoulli beam equation, which accounts for both transverse bending rigidity and nonlinear axial tension, is coupled to a one-dimensional fluid model obtained from depth-averaging the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations across the channel height. Specifically, the Navier--Stokes equations are scaled in the viscous (lubrication) limit relevant to microfluidics. The resulting set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is solved numerically through a segregated approach employing fully-implicit time stepping and second-order finite-difference discretizations. Internal FSI iterations and under-relaxation are employed to handle the stiff nonlinear algebraic problems within each time step. The Reynolds number $Re$ and a dimensionless Young's modulus $\Sigma$ are varied independently to explore the unsteady FSI behaviors in this parameter space. A critical $Re$ is defined by determining when the maximum steady-state deformation of the microchannel's soft wall exceeds a certain a priori threshold. Our numerical results suggest a universal scaling of this critical $Re$ scales as $\Sigma^{3/4}$. Furthermore, the maximum wall displacement and inlet pressures at steady state are shown to correlate with a single dimensionless group, namely $Re/\Sigma^{0.9}$. Finally, the linear stability of the final (inflated) microchannel shape is assessed via a modal eigenvalue analysis, showing the existence of many marginally stable modes, which further highlights the computational challenge of simulating unsteady FSIs.
