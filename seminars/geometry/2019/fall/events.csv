8,27,3:30 pm,MATH 112,Dmitri Pavlov,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,https://dmitripavlov.org,DoubleT.jpg,What is a geometric cohomology theory?,"I will talk about my series of research projects on geometric models for cohomology theories.  I will start with the traditional definition by Eilenberg and Steenrod, in which a cohomology theory is a sequence of functors $h^n\colon{\rm Top}^{\rm op}\to{\rm Ab}$ together with coboundary maps $\partial^n\colon h^n(A)\to h^{n+1}(X/A)$ and explain how it can be generalized to better capture the geometric aspects of such theories."
