Our research concerns the numerical solution of the Eddy Currents Equation coupled with the Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert Equation.  We construct a partitioned implicit Runge-Kutta (PIRK) timestepper with one component being L-stable and the other being quadratic invariant-preserving (QIP).  Mixed (Nedelec,Lagrange)-elements are employed for spatial discretization.  We discuss using the resulting scheme for simulations and validation tests.  Remarks on software implementation will be provided.
