ABSTRACT.
We study some problems in geophysical fluids dynamics.
Our focus is the Navier-Stokes equations in a 3D domain $\Omega_\varepsilon$, whose thickness is of order $0(\varepsilon)$
as $\varepsilon\to 0$, having non-trivial topography.
The velocity field is subject to the Navier friction boundary condition on the bottom and top boundaries of $\Omega_\varepsilon$.
Unlike our previous work, here we consider the case when the friction coefficients are of exact order $\varepsilon^\delta$, for $\delta\in[0,1]$, and no conditions are imposed on the domains.
It is shown that if the initial data, resp., the body force, belongs to a large set of $H^1(\Omega_\varepsilon)$, resp., $L^2(\Omega_\varepsilon)$, then the strong solution of the Navier-Stokes equations exists for all time.
Our proofs rely on a uniform Korn inequality which is established  without any restrictions on the domains; the study of the dependence of the Stokes operator on $\varepsilon$;
and the non-linear estimate which has to deal with the interactions between the boundary condition and the inertial term in the Navier-Stokes equations.
