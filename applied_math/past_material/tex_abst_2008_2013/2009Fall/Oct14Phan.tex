\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
We consider the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations $i\partial_t \psi = H_0 \psi + \lambda |\psi|^2\psi$ in $\mathbb{R}^3 \times [0,\infty)$ where $H_0 = -\Delta + V$ and $\lambda = \pm 1$. Assume that the potential $V$ is radial and decays sufficiently fast at infinity. Assume also that the linear Hamiltonian $H_0$ has only two discrete eigenvalues $e_0 < e_1 <0$ where $e_0$ is simple and $e_1$ has multiplicities 3. We show that there exist three branches of nonlinear excited states and for certain finite codimesion subset in the space of initial data, we construct solutions $\psi$ converging to these excited states in both non-resonant and resonant cases.

This is the joint work with Stephen Gustafson.
