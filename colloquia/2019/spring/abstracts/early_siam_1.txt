Min Wang - Title: An Introduction to Bayesian Hypothesis Testing in High
Dimensions
Abstract: In this talk, we briefly discuss how to implement Bayes
factor-based procedures for the hypothesis testing problems and
study their asymptotic properties when the model dimension grows
with the sample size. We first consider the Bayes factor for
ANOVA designs as an intermediate step toward developing the
Bayes factors for general linear hypothesis testing that has been
well studied in the frequentist literature. Finally, we generalize the
Bayes factor method for testing equality of means of two normal
populations in the "large-p, small-n" setting.
Chunmei Wang - Title: Weak Galerkin (WG) Finite Element Methods for PDEs
Abstract: The speaker will present the basic principles of weak
Galerkin (WG) finite element methods for second order elliptic
problems. An abstract framework for WG will be presented and
discussed for its potential in the scientific applications.
