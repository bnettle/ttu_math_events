In this talk, we will overview the recent developments in the theory of minimal surfaces, and constant mean curvature surfaces in 3-manifolds. 
In particular, we will discuss the asymptotic Plateau problem in $ H^3 $ and $ H^2 \times R $, the Calabi-Yau conjecture, and minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
