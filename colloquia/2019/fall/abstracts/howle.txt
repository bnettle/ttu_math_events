Many important engineering and scientific systems require the solution of time-dependent PDE systems. &nbsp;These sytems often have specific stability needs, such as needing A-stable or L-stable methods, in order to compute realistic solutions. &nbsp;For example, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow are diferential algebraic equations (DAE), and can be viewed as indefinitely stiff. L-stable time stepping methods can be beneficial in this case.

Certain classes of implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods, such as the Radau I and Radau II methods, provide L-stability. &nbsp;However, one price of using IRK methods is the need to solve large linear systems at each time step. &nbsp;For example, if our PDE has been linearized and discretized with  $  N $ degrees of freedom, using an $ s $-stage IRK method leads to an $ sN \times sN $ linear system that must be solved at each time step. &nbsp;We investigate preconditioners for such systems.
