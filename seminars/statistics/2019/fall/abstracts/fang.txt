A common problem in modern genetic research is comparing the mean vectors of two population means in high dimensional settings, that is, in ‘large-p-small-n’ settings. However, the classical Hotelling’s test cannot be applied since the sample covariance matrix is singular. To circumvent these limitations, we proposed a Bayesian two-sample test for the equality of population means in high dimension by clustering. Our proposed Bayesfactor is invariant under linear transformations of the marginal distributions and has closed form expression. We showed by simulation that our proposed Bayesian procedure has higher power than competing tests in the literature.
