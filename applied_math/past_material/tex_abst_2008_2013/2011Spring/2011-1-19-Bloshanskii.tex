\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
We investigate problem of convergence of Fourier expansions
(trigonometric Fourier series, Walsh-Fourier series, Fourier integrals) in multidimensional
case, namely, we are interested in the following problem. What sort of structural and geometric characteristics should a set $E$, $E \subset T^N=(0,1)^N$, $N\ge 2$, possess and what sort of smoothness (minimal smoothness) should a function $f$ have on $E$ as well as on $CE=T^N\setminus E$ in order that Fourier expansion of $f$  would converge almost everywhere on $E$.
