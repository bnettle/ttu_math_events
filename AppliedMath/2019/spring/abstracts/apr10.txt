The speaker will present a new numerical method which is devised and analyzed for a type of ill-posed elliptic Cauchy problems by using the primal-dual weak Galerkin finite element method. This new primal-dual weak Galerkin algorithm is robust and efficient in the sense that the system arising from the scheme is symmetric, well-posed, and is satisfied by the exact solution (if it exists). The speaker will show some numerical results to demonstrate the efficiency of the primal-dual weak Galerkin method as well as the accuracy of the numerical approximations.
