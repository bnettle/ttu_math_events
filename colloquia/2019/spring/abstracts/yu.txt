In this talk, we present a method to analyze certain slow-fast
motions in dynamical systems. For singular perturbed dynamical
systems, the well-known Geometric Singular Perturbation Method
(GSPM) is usually applied to find the special limit cycles -- slowfast periodic solutions. However, many practical problems might
be not able or very difficult to be put in the form of singular
perturbed equations, but they still exhibit slow-fast motions. For
such cases, based on dynamical system theory, we developed a
method to identify and analyze certain slow-fast motions. We will
use several biological examples to illustrate our method, and give
a comparison between the GSPM and our method.
