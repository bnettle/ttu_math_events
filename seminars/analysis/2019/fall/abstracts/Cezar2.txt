In this second talk, we explain in more details the techniques that appear in Zagier's famous paper
(https://annals.math.princeton.edu/

on the evaluation of the multiple zeta values
$$H(r, s)=\zeta(\underbrace{2, 2, \ldots, 2}_{r}, 3, \underbrace{2, 2, \ldots, 2}_{s} )$$
as a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of $\pi^{2m}\zeta(2n+1)$ with $m+n=r+s+1$.
The formula is derived indirectly by considering two generating functions which at first, can be expressed in two completely different quantities, but in the
end, it turns out that they are equal!
Zagier's proof  uses a combination of techniques involving
${}_{3}F_{2} $-hypergeometric function as well as products of sine and digamma
functions. Moreover, we also give an account into a direct proof using rational zeta series involving the coefficient $\zeta(2n)$.
