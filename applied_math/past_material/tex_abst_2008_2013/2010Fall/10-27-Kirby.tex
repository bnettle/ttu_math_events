\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
Many successful block preconditioners for Navier-Stokes  
discretizations require an approximation to the Schur complement as a  
sub-process.  However, the Schur complement is itself a nice operator,  
and iterative methods may be applied directly to it.  We will explore  
whether or not this is a good idea in terms of theory and practice,  
and will also look at some extensions to coupled fluid/temperature  
problems.
