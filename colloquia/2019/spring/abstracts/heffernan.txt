 Many childhood diseases are vaccine preventable. However,
there continue to be many cases of such vaccine preventable diseases
every year, even in countries with high vaccination coverage. It has
been indicated that waning immunity may be the culprit in such
situations. Mathematical models of waning immunity based on the
SIRS, SIRVS, or SIRWS frameworks have indeed shown that this
could be case. We continue in this venue, by adding new components
to models of waning immunity that allow for further study of this topic,
including immune status dependent susceptibility and transmissibility.
In this talk I will review our models (and their connection to the
underlying biology) and I will provide two case studies of waning
immunity and vaccination using models with and without age structure.
The basic reproduction and control reproduction numbers will be
derived. Strategies for pathogen elimination will be discussed.
