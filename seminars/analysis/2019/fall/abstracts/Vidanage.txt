We are interested in classifying various types of canonical domains which are conformally equivalent to any domain arbitrarily given in the complex plane. Among the techniques of conformal uniformization, extremum problems play a significant role. The central object of the theory is that univalent analytic functions in a given domain form a normal family which guarantees the existence of an extremal element for a reasonable extremum problem. We give an extremal problem which uniformized a given finitely connected subdomain $\Omega$ in $z$-sphere with $\infty \in \Omega $ onto a domain bounded by rectangles with sides parallel to real and imaginary axis having the conformal module $m$.
