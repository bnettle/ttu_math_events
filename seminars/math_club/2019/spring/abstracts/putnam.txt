 In the first part of this joint talk, we give a detailed description of Problem Solving (MATH-4000), Fall
2018. The course teaches important skills in problem-solving that are not taught in a systematic way in
any other course. These skills are extremely valuable in preparing students for jobs and for graduatelevel research. The teaching style will be a mixture of a lecture and a problem-solving session. By the
end of this course, students should develop fundamental problem-solving skills, and become
accustomed to concentrating on a problem for an extended period of time. Indeed, this seminar
concentrates on the raw creative problem-solving skills which can serve as an essential ingredient in
almost every field of activity. This course will be offered again this Fall under MATH 4000-Problem
Solving for Putnam and we invite all interested students to register.
Ultimately, this course is designed to train the best math & science undergraduate students at TTU for
the most prestigious competition: The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition.
In the second part of the talk, a Putnam A1-2018 will be presented by Alexander who was a competitor
last year.
