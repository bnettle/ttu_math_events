Since Fall 2008, the seminar provides a venue for researchers and students 
to present and discuss mathematical approaches for the investigation of challenging real-life problems.
Topics range from pure mathematical subjects to applications.

The seminar also aims to encourage students to develop their own research projects.

We welcome all those who want to broaden their perspective on the mathematical methods used in contemporary research...
