Free boundary minimal hypersurfaces locally minimize the area when the boundary is free to move on a given domain. The Morse index gives the number of distinctive deformations that would decrease the area to the second order. It is of most important to understand hypersurfaces with small indices and the Fraser-Schoen conjecture and its cousins are fundamental in this direction. As a consequence, we will discuss how numerical arguments can be used to address those conjectures.
