\newcommand{\talkabstract}{
In 1998, Don Zagier studied the numbers $B_{n}^{*}$ which he
called the 'modified Bernoulli numbers'. They satisfy amusing variants of the
properties of the ordinary Bernoulli numbers. Recently, Victor H. Moll,
Christophe Vignat and I studied an obvious generalization of the modified
Bernoulli numbers, which we call 'Zagier polynomials'. These polynomials
are also rich in structure, and we have shown that a theory parallel to that of ordinary
Bernoulli polynomials exists. Zagier showed that his asymptotic formula for $B_{2n}^{*}$
can be replaced by an exact formula. In an ongoing joint work with M. L. Glasser and
K. Mahlburg, we have shown that a similar thing is true for the Zagier 
polynomials. This exact formula involves Chebyshev polynomials and infinite series of
Bessel function $Y_{n}(z)$. Through a motivation coming from diffraction theory, 
C. M. Linton has already proved this, but in a disguised form, and our proof is new
and gives new results along the way. We also derive Zagier's formula as a limiting case
of this general formula, which is interesting in itself. In the
second part of my talk, I will discuss another generalization of the modified Bernoulli 
numbers that we recently studied along with A. Kabza, namely 'modified N\"{o}rlund polynomials'
$B_{n}^{(\alpha)*}$ , $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$, and obtain their generating
function along with applications.â€‹ The talk will include an interesting mix of special functions, 
number theory, probability and umbral calculus.
