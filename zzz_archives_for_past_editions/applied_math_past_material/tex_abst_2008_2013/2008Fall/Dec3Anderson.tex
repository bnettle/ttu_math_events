ABSTRACT. I will be giving a talk on some (what I believe to be interesting) facts about the history of motor control from a physiological standpoint.  This is part one of several talks I have prepared on this subject for the Control Theory seminar.  My focus Wednesday will be on some basic terminology, historical perspectives, technological advances, and anatomy concepts. The goal is to provide not only a glimpse into the important field of motor control, but also establish a foundation for the later presentations, which are mathematical in nature.
