First we shall present some basic facts about condenser capacity,
analytic capacity and holomorphic motions.
Then we will discuss superharmonicity properties of those
capacities under holomorphic motions and, given a condenser, we will
describe the holomorphic motions for which harmonicity occurs. Finally, we will examine a
special holomorphic motion and characterize the condensers for which
harmonicity occurs.
